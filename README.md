## 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Christabel

I’m an undergraduate in Computer Science, exploring the edges of tech — from design to cloud systems, and everything in between.

Lately, I’ve been focused on:
- 🎨 **UX Design** – understanding how people interact with things, and how to make those things better
- ☁️ **Cloud Computing** – figuring out how systems scale and stay up
- 🧪 **QA Testing** – learning how to test things that break (and why)
- 🤖 **Human-Centered AI** – because I think tech should feel more human
- 🛠️ **DevOps** – still new to me, but on my radar

I'm learning through courses, curiosity, and hands-on practice. It's not linear, but it’s mine.

### 🪴 A little more:
- 📚 Currently taking the **Google UX Design** course + **AWS bootcamp**
- 🔍 I’m drawn to roles that blend people, systems, and design
- 🧠 Still early in my journey — just learning in public, one skill at a time

### ☁️ What’s Next?
Probably building small projects, breaking them, and learning how to fix them better.  
Still figuring things out — and that’s okay.
